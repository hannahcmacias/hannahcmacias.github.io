            <h3>Welcome to my personal website. I'm a rising senior at Barnard
                graduating in May 2024 focusing on Applications and Software Development. 
                As a passionate technologist, my ultimate goal is to make a positive and 
                lasting social impact. I specialize in creating technology that delivers engaging 
                user experiences and makes a real difference in people's lives. I love connecting with users,
                understanding their specific needs and feedback, and using that insight to create products that 
                meet their requirements. With a strong focus on user-centric design principles, I strive to develop 
                intuitive and immersive applications, websites, and digital solutions that leave a lasting impression.
                Through a combination of technical expertise and a creative mindset, I aim to push the boundaries of
                technology to contribute to a better and more inclusive world. 
                Let's collaborate to create something truly remarkable and meaningful.
